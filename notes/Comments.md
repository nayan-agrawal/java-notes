# Comments in Java
Java supports three types of comments
 - **Single-line comments**: Used to comment a single line of code. They start with //.
- **Multi-line comments**: Used to comment multiple lines of code. They start with /* and end with */.
 - **Java doc comments**: Used to generate documentation. They start with /** and end with */.


```
public class CommentsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This is a single-line comment.
        /*
        * This is a multi-line comment.
        * It spans multiple lines.
        */
        /**
        * This is a Javadoc comment.
        * It provides documentation for the code.
        */
    }
}
