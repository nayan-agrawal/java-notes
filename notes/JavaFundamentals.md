# Java Fundamentals

## Variables

#### What are Variables?
 - Variables are nothing but imaginery boxes used to store data in memory during program execution. In Java, you need to declare a variable before using it.

#### Variables and Data Types
 - Java supports various data types, including primitive types (int, double, boolean) and reference types or non-primitive date types (String, arrays, objects, class, interface).
 - Primitive data types in Java are categorized into four groups: integer types, floating-point types, character type, and boolean type.

Examples of variable initializations and declarations
```
int number; // variable declaration
number = 56; // variable initialization
String name = "Nayan" // variable declaration and initialization
```

#### Rules to declare variables in Java
 - A variable name can consist of Capital letters A-Z, lowercase letters a-z digits 0-9, and two special characters such as _ underscore and $ dollar sign.
 - The first character must not be a digit.
 - Blank spaces cannot be used in variable names.
 - Java keywords cannot be used as variable names.
 - Variable names are case-sensitive.
 - There is no limit on the length of a variable name but by convention, it should be between 4 to 15 chars.
 - Variable names always should exist on the left-hand side of assignment operators.

## Operators and Expressions
 - Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Java
supports a wide range of operators, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and more.
 - Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, % (modulus).
 - Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=.
 - Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=.
 - Logical operators: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT).
