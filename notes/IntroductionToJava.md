# Introduction to Java

### What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language developed by **James Gosling** and his team at **Sun Microsystems** (later acquired by Oracle Corporation). It was released in **1995** and is widely used for building various types of applications, including web, mobile, enterprise, and desktop applications.

### History
 - Java was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems (now
owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s.
 - It was originally designed for programming consumer electronic devices, but its focus shifted towards internet programming.
 - The first version of Java, Java 1.0, was released in 1996.

Here are the key milestones in the history of Java:
 - 1991: The project "Oak" begins at Sun Microsystems.
 - 1995: Java 1.0 is released to the public.
 - 1997: Java 1.1 is released, introducing inner classes and JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler support.
 - 2004: Java 5 (Java 1.5) is released, introducing major updates like Generics, Annotations, and Enumerations.
 - 2011: Oracle Corporation acquires Sun Microsystems, becoming the official
maintainer of Java.
 - 2014: Java 8 is released with significant updates, including Lambda expressions and Streams API.
 - 2017: Java 9 is released with the introduction of modules and JShell
 - 2018: Java 10 and Java 11 are released with various enhancements.
 
### Java Features and Benefits
 - **Simple and easy to learn**: Java has a straightforward syntax and a rich set of libraries, making it accessible for beginners.
 - **Object-oriented**: Java follows an object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, allowing for modular and reusable code with the use of classes and objects to structure code.
 - **Platform independence**: Java code is compiled into platform-independent
bytecode, which can run on any system with a compatible JVM.
 - **Robust and secure**: Java includes features like garbage collection and built-in exception handling, with features like class loaders and a security manager ensuring reliable and secure code.
 - **Rich API**: Java provides a vast standard library (API) for various tasks, from input/output operations to networking and database access.
 - **Multithreading**: Java supports concurrent programming with built-in thread management, allowing for efficient utilization of system resources.
 - **High performance**: Java's Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and optimized runtime make it a high-performance language.
 - **Garbage Collection**: Java automatically manages memory through garbage
collection, freeing developers from manual memory management.

### Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
 - The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an integral part of the Java platform and acts as an execution environment for Java programs.
 - It provides a layer of abstraction between the Java code and the underlying
operating system.
 - JVM interprets compiled Java bytecode and translates it into machine code
specific to the host system.
 - It handles memory management, garbage collection, and runtime optimizations
for efficient execution of Java programs.
 - JVM implementations are available for various platforms, allowing Java
programs to run consistently across different systems.

### Java Development Kit (JDK)
 - The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment that
provides tools, libraries, and documentation for Java development.
 - It includes the Java compiler (javac) to compile Java source code into bytecode.
 - JDK also contains the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which includes the
JVM and necessary libraries to run Java applications.
 - Developers use the JDK to write, compile, and debug Java programs.
 - It is available in different versions, with each version introducing new features and improvements.
  

To start programming in Java, you need to install the Java Development Kit
(JDK) on your system. Once installed, you can use a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write Java code.
 
#### Differentiate between JDK, JRE and JVM
 - **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: It is a software development kit that includes all the tools necessary for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications.
 - **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: It is an environment that allows you to run Java applications. It includes the JVM and the necessary libraries and other files required to execute Java applications but does not contain development tools.
 - **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: It is a virtual machine that executes Java byte code. It abstracts the hardware and operating system details, providing platform independence for Java programs.
