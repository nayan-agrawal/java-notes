# Multithreading and Concurrency in Java

## Multitasking
It allows several activities to occur concurrently on the computer.
There are two types of multitasking as follows
 - Process based multitasking
 - Thread based multitasking


**Process based multitasking**
Allows processes to run concurrently on the computer.
Eg: Running the MS Paint while also working with word processor.

**Thread Based Multitasking**
Allows parts of the same program to run concurrently on the computer
Eg: MS Word that is printing and formatting the test at the same time.
